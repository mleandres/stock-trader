You can access the app here: [Stock Trader Simulator](https://ml-stock-trader.firebaseapp.com)

Made with: 
 - [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
 - Some [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) stylings for header, buttons, panels (being replaced with custom styles)
 - [Google Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) for authentication, secure tokens, and database (soon to be replaced with a custom stack)

Disclaimers:
 - List of stocks is completely arbitrary
